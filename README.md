# Boxcar Willie

![Boxcar Willie (tomato)](./boxcar_willie.jpg)

This is a pomodoro timer and a port of [tomaty](https://github.com/ejmg/tomaty). I wrote this to motivate learning more Rust and GTK3.

To install,

```
$ cargo install
```

Then it should be in `~/.local/bin` or your operating system's equivalent.
